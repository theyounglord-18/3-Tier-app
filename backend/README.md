# Server Documentation for My MERN App

This README file provides information about the server-side of the My MERN App project.

## Overview

The server is built using Node.js and Express, and it serves as the backend for the MERN stack application. It handles API requests, connects to a MongoDB database, and manages application logic.

## Directory Structure

- **src/**: Contains the main application code.
  - **app.js**: The entry point for the server application. Sets up middleware and connects to the database.
  - **routes/**: Contains route definitions for the application.
    - **index.js**: Sets up the routes and links them to the appropriate controllers.
  - **controllers/**: Contains the logic for handling requests.
    - **exampleController.js**: Handles requests related to the example model.
  - **models/**: Contains Mongoose models for the application.
    - **exampleModel.js**: Defines the schema and methods for interacting with the example data.
  - **config/**: Contains configuration files.
    - **db.js**: Configuration for connecting to the MongoDB database.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```
   cd my-mern-app/server
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the server, run the following command in the server directory:
```
npm start
```

The server will run on the specified port (default is 5000). You can access the API at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set up the necessary environment variables for your database connection. You can create a `.env` file in the root of the server directory to store these variables.
